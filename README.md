# Minesweeper

Game by: Raymond Li and David Tuck.

Please download Source Code.zip and extract the java files and dependecies to prevent naming issues. Ensure that files are not renamed and are all kept in the same folder.

Read the description in the header of each class for more information on what they do.

The attached jar file is a compiled version of the source code, ready to run.

I personally guarantee a lack of viruses or other kinds of malware in the jar file and the zip file.

Clicking How To Play from the main game will lead to minesweeper.info, a website neither created nor maintained by either of us. We take no responsibility for anything that that website may do.

To run the java program, run the Minesweeper.java class or the Minesweeper.jar executable jar file.

No part of our code may be duplicated in any way or means without the attachment of this README.md. Otherwise, go ahead and do whatever you like with it.
